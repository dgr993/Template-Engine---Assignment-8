# Template-Engine---Assignment-8

I completed a node.js to make a simple team. I uploaded js to complete tests that were previously made and i made a main js file to get the information from the user and push it to the file team.html

some issues i ran into was mainly just knowing how to map it out in my mind and knowing what to put next. sometimes its like a big bowl of alphabet soup and i need to place things in the right place.
